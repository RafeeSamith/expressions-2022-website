                    Over the years - with the cooperation and innovation of thousands of intelligent minds - a multitude of solutions are on the rise to battle the rapidly declining condition of our environment. The key step to be taken is  to eliminate the use of fossil fuels with immediate effect; which is proving to be a long, time-consuming endeavour as much of the world's infrastructure has been built around the use of fossil fuels.
                </span>
                <span>
                    In spite of this, steps are being taken to transition to more viable and renewable sources of energy such as solar, wind, hydroelectricity and more
                    At first glance these solutions have major advantages, but it is worthy to note their grey areas too in order to be inclined to make the appropriate decisions to help our environment.
                </span>

                <br>
                <h2>WIND</h2>
                <div class="title-line"></div>
                <span>
                    Wind power is another popular and sustainable source of energy, using turbines to convert wind energy to electricity. It has also historically been used in sails, windmills and windpumps.
                </span>
                <span>
                    Like solar, the emissions of wind power in use is negligible compared to fossil fuels and its downsides lie elsewhere; namely habitat loss and the effect on landscape due to their vast spacing requirements. Turbines are made of fiberglass which only last 10 to 20 years with no market to recycle them; causing them to end up in landfills. Turbines were also made of balsa wood, which is in short supply, leaving a trail of destruction by deforestation of the Amazon Forest. On the bright side, technological advancements like 3D printing can aid in the development of alternative materials like resins to produce the turbines

                <br>
                <h2>SOLAR</h2>
                <div class="title-line"></div>
                <span>
                    Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into energy, this is an especially plausible solution as there is an abundance of solar energy from our Sun to extract energy from. The energy is obtained in two ways, either by concentrating the sunlight into a small area to drive a heat engine or most commonly using special materials to convert light into current, working on the principle of the Photovoltaic Effect. This is an important note as solar cells are indeed a boon for the environment as it has no emissions during use. Instead, the issues lie during the production of these cells. A 2021 study estimated the carbon footprint of manufacturing monocrystalline panels at 515 g CO2/kWp in the US and 740 g CO2/kWp in China. This number is hopefully expected to fall as manufacturers begin using clean electricity and recycled materials.

                <h2>ELECTRIC VEHICLES</h2>
                <div class="title-line"></div>
                <span>
                    For almost two hundred years, internal combustion engines have ruled all of automotive means of transport. Until very recently - with the development of electric motors and cells to store adequate energy - vehicles are being manufactured to be able to run on electricity. This is immediately a substantial improvement over the internal combustion engines of old as they have virually no carbon emissions during use. But just like solar, it leaves its impact during manufacturing. Vehicle batteries rely on mining of rare earth metals such as cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium. These metals are obtained in open-pit mines and are detrimental to the environment. These vehicles must also be charged and thus relies on the power generation medium that their respective region uses.

                <br>
                <h2>NUCLEAR POWER</h2>
                <div class="title-line"></div>
                <span>
                    Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions to produce electricity, obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions. It is an extremely sustainable source of energy but is unfortunately controversial due to accidental events such as the Chernobyl Disaster of 1986. 
                </span>
                <span>
                    A pellet of nuclear fuel weighs approximately 6 grams. However, that single pellet yields the amount of energy equivalent to that generated by 1000kg of coal, 120 gallons of oil or 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas, making nuclear fuel much more efficient than fossil fuels. Although disposing of the radioactive materials and decomissioning a nuclear power plant poses a huge economical challenge to the companies.
