                    Plastics pollution has a direct and deadly effect on wildlife. Thousands of seabirds and sea turtles, seals and other marine mammals are killed each year after ingesting plastic or getting entangled in it. Endangered wildlife like Hawaiian monk seals and Pacific loggerhead sea turtles are among nearly 700 species that eat and get caught in plastic litter.

                    In the first decade of this century, we made more plastic than all the plastic in history up to the year 2000. And every year, billions of pounds of more plastic end up in the world's oceans. Studies estimate there are now 15‚Äì51 trillion pieces of plastic in the world's oceans ‚Äî from the equator to the poles, from Arctic ice sheets to the sea floor. Not one square mile of surface ocean anywhere on earth is free of plastic pollution.

                    The problem is growing into a crisis. The fossil fuel industry plans to increase plastic production by 40 percent over the next decade. These oil giants are rapidly building petrochemical plants across the United States to turn fracked gas into plastic. This means more toxic air pollution and plastic in our oceans.

                    Globally, the average is 20%; the remaining 80% is undocumented, with much ending up buried under the ground for centuries as landfill. E-waste is not biodegradable. The lack of recycling weighs heavily on the global electronic industry and as devices become more numerous, smaller and more complex, the issue escalates. Currently, recycling some types of e-waste and recovering materials and metals is an expensive process. The remaining mass of e-waste mainly plastics laced with metals and chemicals poses a more intractable problem.

                    Plastic does not biodegrade though it does break up into smaller pieces eventually, taking many years to split into macro- and micro-pieces. Micro-plastics are ingested by fish and sea mammals. Styrofoam, for example, breaks into highly toxic polystyrene components that sink lower into the ocean and spread throughout the sea column. Smaller pieces of plastic also act like sponges and soak up other toxins, which are ingested first by marine animals and then by humans in the contaminated fish. Mercury in fish has been reported for years, and, more recently, lead and cadmium have also been detected; these heavy metals are all dangerous to humans and cause cancer and nervous system disorders, among other health problems.
