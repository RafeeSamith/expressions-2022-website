                    Biomedical waste may be solid or liquid. Examples of infectious waste include discarded blood, sharps, unwanted microbiological cultures and stocks, identifiable body parts (including those as a result of amputation), other human or animal tissue, used bandages and dressings, discarded gloves, other medical supplies that may have been in contact with blood and body fluids, and laboratory waste that exhibits the characteristics described above. Waste sharps include potentially contaminated used needles, scalpels, lancets and other devices capable of penetrating skin.

                    Biomedical waste is distinct from normal trash or general waste, and differs from other types of hazardous waste, such as chemical, radioactive, universal or industrial waste. Medical facilities generate waste hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials. While such wastes are normally not infectious, they require proper disposal. Some wastes are considered multihazardous, such as tissue samples preserved in formalin. Biomedical waste should be collected in containers that are leak-proof and sufficiently strong to prevent breakage during handling.

                    Containers of biomedical waste are marked with a biohazard symbol. The container, marking, and labels are often red.Disposal of this waste is an environmental concern, as many medical wastes are classified as infectious or biohazardous and could potentially lead to the spread of infectious disease. The most common danger for humans is the infection which also affects other living organisms in the region. Daily exposure to the wastes leads to accumulation of harmful substances or microbes in the person's body.
                    Potentially hazardous microbes found in medical waste have the potential to infect hospital patients, medical personnel, and members of the general public. Drug-resistant bacteria that escape from healthcare institutions and into the environment are another possible risk.

                    The most prevalent issues with health-care waste include a lack of knowledge about the health risks associated with it, inadequate training in proper waste management, a lack of waste management and disposal systems, a lack of resources
                    and a low priority given to the issue. Many nations either do not have the necessary laws or do not enforce them. Approximately 85% of the total waste produced by health care operations is ordinary, non-hazardous waste that is equivalent to household trash. Hazardous material, which may be infectious, toxic, or radioactive, makes up the remaining 15%.
