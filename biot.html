                    Biotechnology is uniquely positioned to replace polluting materials and chemical processes with more sustainable, biological alternatives. This scientific field draws from millions of years of evolution in which living beings have specialized in producing and recycling all kinds of compounds and materials. These biological processes can be used to efficiently break down waste and produce materials with lower pollution, water, land, and energy use than traditional methods. The number of applications where biotechnology could make a difference towards sustainability is virtually unlimited. Here are 10 of the areas where biotech is already making an impact. Plastic pollution is one of the major environmental issues we‚Äôre currently facing. The waste from petrochemical plastic production plants, as well as the tonnes of non-biodegradable plastic that is thrown away daily, are huge problems for the environment. New technologies that incorporate biology in the production of plastics could offer a more sustainable alternative.

                    Stronger and more sustainable detergents are one of the earliest applications of industrial biotechnology. Back in the 60s, Danish biotech giant Novozymes started selling the first enzymatic detergents. They consist of specialized enzymes obtained from microorganisms that are able to break down molecules behind difficult stains, such as blood and fat. And unlike chemical alternatives, enzymatic detergents are biodegradable.

                    Over time, new generations of enzymatic detergents have become more and more effective. A key advantage is that they can work at lower temperatures, therefore reducing the amount of energy spent on washing clothes. In addition, enzymatic detergents can be used to clean medical equipment more thoroughly and efficiently than common cleaning solutions. The meat industry is a huge polluter. Biotechnology could significantly reduce the use of land, water, and energy by growing meat without the animal, directly from a small sample of muscle and fat cells. This approach would also reduce the use of antibiotics in meat production as it can be created in sterile lab conditions.
